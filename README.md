# Encryption-and-Decryption-using-RC4-Algorithm-
This project implements the RC4 stream cipher algorithm in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. It showcases how plaintext can be encrypted and decrypted using a symmetric key, demonstrating the internal workings of RC4 including key scheduling and pseudo-random byte generation.
